We've all heard rants about job satisfaction. Have we ever thought for once about work satisfaction ? Are happy doing what we do? Are we in it for the money alone? Are we doing. Good job of what's given to us?
We all complain when a fellow teammate is acknowledged with a promotion. We tend to go behind his/her back and go n about why he/she doesn't deserve what they just got. All we find ourselves doing is merely trying to please who we work for. Does it matter to the founder of an organisation that his walls are painted neat as he arrives? Wouldn't it be better for nice to actually find that people seem to have become better at what they do.
I think jobs are not about the money alone. Money is the maor part of why we work. A good pay keeps us happy and is necessary for our very existence. But how much of it do we actually deserve.
How many of us can seriously walk out of office and say to ourselves, yes, I'm really happy about what I achieved today, I've earned my bread!
It's something we all got to think about. How often do we leave all the tough work to the smart guy in the team? Ya whatever the problem. He will have. A solution. This problem lies in jobs which require a so called intellect. A janitorial job usually isn't paged with such things. They know they've got to clean the toilet and the only way that's going to happen is by scrubbing hard.
We all claim to be passionate about what we do, then, why crib! Why leave the job to that knew expert in the team?
Why don't we take an initiative to actually do something for once. There's no 
Problem for which we cannot find a solution. Haven't we all undergone the same formal education? What sets that guy apart? 
It's just the urge to work, to do something, it's for him to feel good about himself at the end of the day. 
That brings us back to my initial discussion. Work satisfaction.

If we all worked, and were pleased about what we did by the end of the day, we will be satisfied. And ya, then after all that, let's think abut Job Satisfacton
